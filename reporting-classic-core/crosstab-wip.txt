Major changes to the engine:

(1) We no longer assume that groups have a header and a footer. Only
    relational-groups and crosstab, crosstab-other group have header
    and footer.
(2) We no longer assume that there is a itemband, detail-header or footer or a no-database next to the itemband.
(3) Setters for these bands are gone (use GroupDataBody's accessors instead), getters now may return <null>.
(4) Crosstab-content is now organized in cells, using a generic "dimension-key" as method to map measure
    and summary cells to their respective position. A cell in itself does not constitute a content definition.
    Must be matched by a row-group and column-group entry. Reference can be generic via ::group-<n> syntax
    where <n> is the sequence number of the group. Only valid for crosstab groups. 
(5) CT: Visibility for full row/col is controlled on the group-header. Visible false on crosstab-cell produces
    empty cell.
(6) CT-cells: are not used as part of a table. CT-Cells are placed *into* table-cells. Border/Background is
    applied to table-cell, crosstab-cell style for these properties is cleared.

Crosstabs have a no-data-band placed in front of the crosstab, with an (future) option
in the generator to disable any generation of the crosstab-table when no data exists.


A CSS style node matching exists now on the ReportElements.

  // BCW: Block context width = the size against which percentages are resolved
  // CW: Computed Width = the computed size of the box. This is a rough estaminate of how the box will be sized later.

-------------------------

after parsing a report:
- check whether the strict-compatiblity flag is set. If set, out.
- If version < 4.0, set strict compatiblity flag.

PRD:
- Offer an option to convert old reports to new system.
- Compatiblity updater.
