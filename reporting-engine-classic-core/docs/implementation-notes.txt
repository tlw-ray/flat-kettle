Page orientation:

LANDSCAPE:
Landscape is defined to be a rotation of the print-stream page to be imaged
by +90 degrees with respect to the medium (i.e. anti-clockwise) from the portrait
orientation. Note: The +90 direction was chosen because simple finishing on the
long edge is the same edge whether portrait or landscape.

REVERSE_LANDSCAPE:
The content will be imaged across the long edge of the medium, but in the opposite
manner from landscape. Reverse-landscape is defined to be a rotation of the print-stream
page to be imaged by -90 degrees with respect to the medium (i.e. clockwise) from the
portrait orientation. Note: The REVERSE_LANDSCAPE value was added because some applications
rotate landscape -90 degrees from portrait, rather than +90 degrees.


Translation Schema:

Portrait:  T L B R =>
Landscape: R B L T
RevLand:   L T R B

A Paper object always receives borders in portrait mode.
