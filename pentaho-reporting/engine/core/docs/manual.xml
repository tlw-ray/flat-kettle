        <title>Who should read this Document</title>

        <para>This document is aimed for application developers, who want to
        use JFreeReport in their own programms. It does not try to be a manual
        that could be handed out to End-Users.</para>

        <para>Ideally the reader should have knowledge of the Java programming
        language and some basic knowledge about how to write XML documents.
        Although general reporting knowledge is no requirement, it surely
        helps to understand the concepts used in JFreeReport.</para>

      <title>Introduction to JFreeReport</title>

      <section>
        <title>What is JFreeReport</title>

        <para>JFreeReport is a free java report library aimed at developers,
        who seek an easy to integrate reporting and printing solution.</para>

        <para>The JFreeReport is basicly a data oriented template engine. The
        report definition describes, how the given data should be processed,
        layouted and finally be printed. Report definitions can either be
        written in XML or can be composed using the Java API. With the help of
        JFreeReport, developers can concentrate on the data instead of having
        to worry about the printing and document creation details. All output
        targets fully support Unicode, so JFreeReport is also well suited for
        printing internationalized, i.e. japanese or chinese content.</para>

        <para>A single carefully crafted report definition allows to print or
        export the same data into PDF documents, Excel workbooks, HTML pages,
        plain text-, RTF or CSV files.</para>

        <para>The report configuration interface allows a very high level of
        customization and easy deployment. Almost every aspect of JFreeReport
        is configurable. The hierachical structure of the configuration allows
        the administrator of the deployment system to define a global system
        specific configuration, while the developer is able to provide usefull
        defaults up to the user level on a per report basis.</para>

        <para>Using JFreeReport, the developer has almost full control over
        the reporting process. The functions and expressions API allows fine
        grained control over the report generation process. Elements can be
        formated and all data can be generated on the fly during the report
        processing, if needed. JFreeReport does not generate any temporary
        files while retaining a low memory footprint.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>What is it not</title>

        <para>JFreeReport is no stand-alone utility. JFreeReport is a
        component library and provides no code to read or prepare data and
        does not generate report definitions on the fly. Report definitions
        must be created before JFreeReport can be used to generate reports.
        The data given for reporting must fit the report definition and it
        should be sorted according to the group definitions in the report
        description.</para>

        <para>JFreeReport is still in its active development phase, therefore
        not all features have been implemented yet.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Technical Requirements</title>

        <para>JFreeReport uses the Java2D API and therefore needs at least JDK
        1.2.2. It will not work with older versions of the Java Development
        Kit. Some optional modules provide support for features found in newer
        versions of Java, for instance the logging framework or extended
        printing of JDK 1.4.</para>

        <para>At the time of this writing, JFreeReport cannot be used with one
        of the opensource implementations of the JDK. The 'ClassPath' library
        does not fully implement the AWT and Graphics2D support needed for
        running JFreeReport. Therefore it will not run with Kaffe, GCJ or any
        other JVM using the ClassPath library.</para>

        <para>Depending on the contents and complexity of the generated
        reports, JFreeReport might need more than the default 64MB heap size.
        The library itself is 100% pure Java and does not rely on native
        libraries. JFreeReport is able to run in headless mode on
        servers.</para>

      <title>Bugs! ... and How to report them</title>

      <para>As JFreeReport is still in active development, it is a sad truth
      that bugs cannot be fully avoided. JFreeReport contains - and certainly
      will contain - many bugs, which will be fixed as soon as they are
      discovered.</para>

      <para>In case you discovered a bug or stumble across an strange odity -
      be it unexpected behaviour of JFreeReport, a weird API definition or
      missing or invalid documentation, or a clear bug indication like false
      results or exceptions and crashes - please don't hesitate to report to
      us about it.</para>

      <para>To help us to replicate the bug, please include details about your
      environment (JDK and Operating System version, the used JFreeReport
      version) and in case of exceptions the complete stacktrace of these
      exceptions. If you could also include a small example of the bug, you
      can consider that bug almost fixed. Bug reports should be posted on
      Sourceforge (<ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jfreereport/">

      <title>Contents of this manual</title>

      <para>Note: The order of the chapters will change</para>

      <para>The manual should give a complete overview about the basics of the
      art of report generation and how to solve that task with the JFreeReport
      library.</para>

      <para>The next chapter will start with a short introduction to general
      report processing techniques and the used algorithms. If you are already
      familiar with report generation techniques, you can easily skip this
      chapter.</para>

      <para>After that, in chapters three and four, we'll go deeper into
      installing and configuring JFreeReport. If you are familiar with
      installing other java libraries, you can safely skip the installation
      instructions and proceed with the configuration instructions located in
      chapter four.</para>

      <para>The next chapter describes the usage of the supplied GUI
      components and how they can be configured and customized.</para>

      <para>Chapters six to nine describe the object model and the
      architecture of the JFreeReport library. Every JFreeReport user should
      have read these chapters, as they are prequesites to use JFreeReport
      successfully.</para>

      <para>The next three chapters will deal with the various methods to
      create a report definition . We'll start with the simple XML format and
      proceed to the extended XML format and finally describe the API based
      report definition methods.</para>

      <para>In chapter 13 we'll have a look at common report definition
      use-cases. The chapter contains several guides on how to define simple
      lists, invoice style reports or forms using JFreeReport.</para>

      <para>The last chapter introduces the various developer tools supplied
      with JFreeReport and gives a short overview about third-party tools
      available.</para>

    <title>A General Introduction to Reporting</title>

    <section>
      <title>Structural Elements</title>

      <para>The tradition of reporting started with the mainframe computers of
      the seventies. Programming languages like Cobol (1960) and RPG (report
      programm generator, 1965) introduced the basic principles used for
      computer based reporting today.</para>

      <para>Reports consist of several bands. Bands are layout container and
      act as template definitions for the actual content. Each band contains
      data fields and static text. The fields on the band are placeholders for
      the data to be printed. When printing bands, the field placeholders get
      replaced by the actual data. The report processor selects the bands to
      be printed, fills in the data and finally generates the content.</para>

      <para>There are several types of bands for the various special purposes
      encountered during a reporting run.</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Pageheader and pagefooter bands are printed on top and bottom
          of each page and contain document and page specific information,
          like the document title, the author or the current and total page
          numbers.</para>

          <para>Page header and footer are special bands, as they do not
          depend directly on the report data. When and whether they will be
          printed depends purely on the defined report layout and the already
          generated content.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The report header contains all the global items one would
          expect on a front page, like the title of the report.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The group header is printed on every start of a group -
          traditionally it contains column headings and introductionary
          information on the next set of rows.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The item band is used to print the bulk data, the record
          contents.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The group footer traditionally contains summary information,
          like computed sums, item counts etc.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The report is finished once the report footer has been
          printed.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Report groups</title>

      <para>Reports used in the real-world-business are more than simple list
      of rows and columns. To gain information from the presented data, the
      report data is sorted and condensed into separate sections, which
      corespond to the logical structure of the report. Therefore report
      engines introduced the concept of groups to support the structuring of
      report data.</para>

      <para>With groups, a set of rows, the report data set, is subdivided
      into an ordered collection of smaller subsets of rows. All rows of a
      group instance share a common attribute. In the domain of relational
      databases, the attribute is defined by the name of one or more columns.
      Within the group instance, all those columns have the same value. That
      set of attributes, which identifies a group, is called the group
      key.</para>

      <para>Groups in the reporting usually can be mapped to 'is-part-of'
      relations in the real world. Employees could be grouped by the
      department, where they work in, or by the first letter of their last
      name.</para>

      <section>
        <title>The Control-Break-Algorithm</title>

        <para>Reporting can be a very resource intenstive process. Data has to
        be queried from databases and other sources, the data must be
        processed, sorted and intermediate results must be computed and
        finally the report output must be generated. Even with today's
        powerfull computers, performance is a key to customer satisfaction. To
        fullfill these performance requirements, it is unacceptable to waste
        time building a global view on the report data unless absolutly
        necessary.</para>

        <para>For performance reasons, group memberships are computed at
        runtime with an algorithm called the 'control-break algorithm'.
        Understanding this algorithm is the key to successful reporting, as
        this algorithm heavily influences how the report engine behaves and
        how groups are built up. The control-break-algorithm does not build a
        global view over all group instances. To detect the end or start of a
        group, it compares the current row with the previously read row of
        data. If the data of one of the group's key columns is different, the
        current group must be finished. If the report processing has not
        reached the last row, a new group instance is opened immediatly. This
        new group will remain active until either the end of the report data
        has been reached or the group key values changed.</para>

        <para><emphasis>Definition:</emphasis></para>

        <para>A <firstterm>group</firstterm> is a contigiuous set of rows,
        where all rows of the group share the same group key.</para>

        <para>A <firstterm>group instance</firstterm> is identified by a
        <firstterm>group key</firstterm>. The key consists of one or more
        attributes, where all entites in that group have the same values
        stored in the specified attributes. When using databases, entity sets
        are usually represented by tables and attributes are represented by
        the table's columns.</para>

        <para>A <firstterm>sub group</firstterm> is a group, which has a key
        that contains all attributes of its parent and has at least one more
        attribute. Therefore, a sub group contains a subset of it's parent's
        rows.</para>

        <para>A group with a group key without attributes defined is called
        the <firstterm>default group</firstterm>. This group has a single
        instance which always spans the complete report data set.</para>

        <para>The single level Control-Break-Algorithm as pseudo code:</para>

        <programlisting>OPEN data-set.

   DO
      PRINT item-band.
      READ
   DONE.

   PRINT group-footer.

PRINT report-footer.
CLOSE data-set.</programlisting>

        <para>and in Java (the complete code for this listing can be found is
        in CVS):</para>

        <programlisting>  public static void main (final String[] args)
  {
    final Object[][] data = initData();

    // cursor at the first row ...
    // in this example modifying the 'position' is equal to a 'read' operation 
    int position = 0;

    printReportHeader(data, position);
    while (isEndOfFile (data, position) == false)
    {
      // initialize the group key with the data from the first row
      // remember the current group key
      // if the group key changes, we have to do a control break ...
      final Object groupKey = data[position][CONTINENT_COL];
      printGroupHeader(data, position);

      while ((isEndOfFile (data, position) == false) &amp;&amp;
             (data[position][CONTINENT_COL].equals(groupKey)))
      {
        // store the last value of the group key (so that we can detect changes)

        // print the items ...
        printItems (data, position);

        // now 'read' the next row of data ...
        position += 1;
      }
      printGroupFooter(data, position - 1);
    }

    printReportFooter(data, position - 1);
  }</programlisting>

        <para>From this algorithm, we can derive some basic principles about

              <para>As only neighbouring rows are compared against each other,
              this algorithm will consider rows to be part of the currrent
              group if and only if all rows of a particular group key instance
              are kept together as direct neigbours in the report

              having an open group.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>The order of the attribute specification within a group

              which one changed.</para>
            </listitem>
          </orderedlist></para>

        <para>By considering the group data to be a new data set, we can stack

            the parent group has been printed. Immediatly after the processing
            finishes, the parent group's footer gets printed. The processing
            flow cannot reach the subgroup without passing through the parent
            group.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>A sub group must cease control as soon as one the parent's

            <para>A control break in one of the parent groups will close all
            subgroups. As soon as the parent group generated a new group
            instance, new instances of the sub groups will be opened as
            well.</para>

            <para>Therefore sub groups must be aware of the group attributes
            of it's parents.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Adding an attribute, which has a constant value, to the

          </table>Of course, we can combine groups to create multi-level
        reports. The control break algorithm allows only one group definition
        per level. That means, we cannot have a report that has top level
        groupings for 'location' and 'department' at the same time. But we are
        able to subdivide groups in an ordered way.</para>

        <para>For example, we can first group by the 'location' and in a
        second step group all locations by it's department. The first level

        <para>The order of the groups is important. There's a difference,
        whether one first groups by the location and then by the department
        column or first by department and then location. As you can see, a
        subgroup is always part of the parent group. When a subgroup's headers
        are printed, the parent group's headers are already fully processed.
        For footers, we can see, that the footer of the subgroup is always
        printed before the parent group's footer gets on the paper.</para>

        <para>Now we switch the group order, the department group is the top
        level group, followed by the 'location' subgroup.</para>

    <title>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</title>

    <para>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.1, February 1999</para>

    <para>Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple
    Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is permitted to copy
    and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it
    is not allowed.</para>

    <para>[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also
    counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2,
    hence the version number 2.1.]</para>

    <para>Preamble</para>

    <para>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
    freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
    Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
    software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</para>

    <para>This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
    specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free
    Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it
    too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license
    or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in
    any particular case, based on the explanations below.</para>

    <para>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
    not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
    this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if
    you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new
    free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these
    things.</para>

    <para>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
    rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you
    if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</para>

    <para>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
    you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
    code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete
    object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the
    library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you
    must show them these terms so they know their rights.</para>

    <para>We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
    library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
    permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</para>

    <para>To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
    there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is
    modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that
    what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's
    reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by
    others.</para>

    <para>Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
    any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively
    restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license
    from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license
    obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full
    freedom of use specified in this license.</para>

    <para>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
    ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General
    Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite
    different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license
    for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into
    non-free programs.</para>

    <para>When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
    a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
    combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General
    Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire
    combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public
    License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the
    library.</para>

    <para>We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
    does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public
    License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an
    advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the
    reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries.
    However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special
    circumstances.</para>

    <para>For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
    encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
    a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to
    use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same
    job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to
    gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the
    Lesser General Public License.</para>

    <para>In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
    programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free
    software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free
    programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system,
    as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.</para>

    <para>Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
    users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked
    with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program
    using a modified version of the Library.</para>

    <para>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work
    based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former
    contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be
    combined with the library in order to run.</para>

    <para>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING,
    DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</para>

    <para>0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
    program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other
    authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this
    Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee
    is addressed as "you".</para>

    <para>A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
    prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which
    use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</para>

    <para>The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
    which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the
    Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright
    law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it,
    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly
    into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without
    limitation in the term "modification".)</para>

    <para>"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all
    the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
    definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
    installation of the library.</para>

    <para>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a
    program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a
    program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
    Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it).
    Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program
    that uses the Library does.</para>

    <para>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
    complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices
    that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and
    distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.</para>

    <para>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
    and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
    fee.</para>

    <para>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute
    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
    that you also meet all of these conditions:</para>

    <para>a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</para>

    <para>b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</para>

    <para>c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge
    to all third parties under the terms of this License.</para>

    <para>d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the
    facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked,
    then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an
    application does not supply such function or table, the facility still
    operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains
    meaningful.</para>

    <para>(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a
    purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.
    Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function
    or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does
    not supply it, the square root function must still compute square
    roots.)</para>

    <para>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and
    can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves,
    then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
    distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same
    sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the
    distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
    permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to
    each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</para>

    <para>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
    contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is
    to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
    collective works based on the Library.</para>

    <para>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
    Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume
    of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
    the scope of this License.</para>

    <para>3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
    License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
    this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that
    they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead
    of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU
    General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version
    instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these
    notices.</para>

    <para>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
    that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
    subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</para>

    <para>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the
    Library into a program that is not a library.</para>

    <para>4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
    derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under
    the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with
    the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange.</para>

    <para>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
    source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute
    the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the
    source along with the object code.</para>

    <para>5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
    Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
    linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in
    isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls
    outside the scope of this License.</para>

    <para>However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
    creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
    contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
    library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6
    states terms for distribution of such executables.</para>

    <para>When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
    that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
    derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether
    this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without
    the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to
    be true is not precisely defined by law.</para>

    <para>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
    structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
    functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file
    is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work.
    (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will
    still fall under Section 6.)</para>

    <para>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
    distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any
    executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not
    they are linked directly with the Library itself.</para>

    <para>6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
    link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work
    containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms
    of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work
    for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such
    modifications.</para>

    <para>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this
    License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during
    execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright
    notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the
    user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these
    things:</para>

    <para>a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes
    were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2
    above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with
    the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code
    and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then
    relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library.
    (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions
    files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the
    application to use the modified definitions.)</para>

    <para>b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of
    the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than
    copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate
    properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one,
    as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version
    that the work was made with.</para>

    <para>c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a,
    above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this
    distribution.</para>

    <para>d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.</para>

    <para>e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</para>

    <para>For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
    Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing
    the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to
    be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
    either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
    and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless
    that component itself accompanies the executable.</para>

    <para>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
    restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany
    the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them
    and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.</para>

    <para>7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
    Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
    facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
    library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the
    Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and
    provided that you do these two things:</para>

    <para>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
    on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be
    distributed under the terms of the Sections above.</para>

    <para>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that
    part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find
    the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</para>

    <para>8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
    the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
    Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
    License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you
    under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
    parties remain in full compliance.</para>

    <para>9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
    distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
    modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library),
    you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms
    and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works
    based on it.</para>

    <para>10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
    Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
    licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to
    these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on
    the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this
    License.</para>

    <para>11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
    any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
    distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not
    permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive
    copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could
    satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
    distribution of the Library.</para>

    <para>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
    under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended
    to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
    circumstances.</para>

    <para>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such
    claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of
    the free software distribution system which is implemented by public
    license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the
    wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on
    consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to
    decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other
    system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</para>

    <para>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
    to be a consequence of the rest of this License.</para>

    <para>12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
    original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may
    add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
    not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation
    as if written in the body of this License.</para>

    <para>13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
    versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ
    in detail to address new problems or concerns.</para>

    <para>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
    Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
    "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the
    Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license
    version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
    Software Foundation.</para>

    <para>14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write
    to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by
    the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two
    goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
    software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software
    generally.</para>

    <para>NO WARRANTY</para>

    <para>15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
    WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER
    PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
    EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.
    SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
    SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</para>

    <para>16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
    DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
    DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING
    BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
    LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO
    OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS
    BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</para>

    <para>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</para>

    <para>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</para>

    <para>If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
    everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
    redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of
    the ordinary General Public License).</para>

    <para>To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
    It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
    effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at
    least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is
    found.</para>

    <para>&lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it
    does.&gt; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;</para>

    <para>This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published
    by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at
    your option) any later version.</para>

    <para>This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
    WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY
    or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public
    License for more details.</para>

    <para>You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307
    USA</para>

    <para>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
    mail.</para>

    <para>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
    your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
    necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:</para>

    <para>Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
    library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random
    Hacker.</para>
