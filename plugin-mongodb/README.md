Pentaho Big Data Plugin
=======================

The Pentaho Big Data Plugin Project provides support for an ever-expanding Big Data community within the Pentaho ecosystem. It is a plugin for the Pentaho Kettle engine which can be used within Pentaho Data Integration (Kettle), Pentaho Reporting, and the Pentaho BI Platform.

Building
--------
The Pentaho Big Data Plugin is built with Apache maven and uses maven for dependency management. All you'll need to get started is to start maven 3.0.1 or newer version to build the project. 

* git clone git://github.com/pentaho/big-data-plugin.git
* cd big-data-plugin
* mvn clean install


This will produce a plugin archive in target/pentaho-big-data-plugin-${project.revision}.tar.gz (and .zip). This archive can then be extracted into your Pentaho Data Integration plugin directory.

How to build
--------------

Pentaho Big Data Plugin uses the maven framework. 


#### Pre-requisites for building the project:
* Maven, version 3+
* Java JDK 1.8
* This [settings.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentaho/maven-parent-poms/master/maven-support-files/settings.xml) in your <user-home>/.m2 directory

#### Building it

This is a maven project, and to build it use the following command

```
$ mvn clean install
```
Optionally you can specify -Drelease to trigger obfuscation and/or uglification (as needed)

Optionally you can specify -Dmaven.test.skip=true to skip the tests (even though
you shouldn't as you know)

The build result will be a Pentaho package located in ```target```.

#### Running the tests

__Unit tests__

This will run all unit tests in the project (and sub-modules). To run integration tests as well, see Integration Tests below.

```
$ mvn test
```

If you want to remote debug a single java unit test (default port is 5005):

```
$ cd core
$ mvn test -Dtest=<<YourTest>> -Dmaven.surefire.debug
```

__Integration tests__

In addition to the unit tests, there are integration tests that test cross-module operation. This will run the integration tests.

```
$ mvn verify -DrunITs
```

To run a single integration test:

```
$ mvn verify -DrunITs -Dit.test=<<YourIT>>
```

To run a single integration test in debug mode (for remote debugging in an IDE) on the default port of 5005:

```
$ mvn verify -DrunITs -Dit.test=<<YourIT>> -Dmaven.failsafe.debug
```

To skip test

```
$ mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

To get log as text file

```
$ mvn clean install test >log.txt
```
